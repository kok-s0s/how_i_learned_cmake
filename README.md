# How i learned CMake

just record it!

and i learned it by using [CMake Official Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html).

---

ok, i finish the tutorial (22-09-01), and now i can try to use it for something funny.

**some thoughts**

1. Try to make a simple calculator.

2. Watch other people's code and make a terminal game.
